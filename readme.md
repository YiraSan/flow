# violetOS

violetOS is a general-purpose and modern operating system dedicated to efficiency, and attention to detail.

violetOS is not POSIX-compliant and does not aim to offer any native compatibility with common standards. Do not expect anything to function as you are accustomed to.

## Compilation 

Linux and macOS are actively supported. Windows IS and WILL be unsupported to compile on, since WSL exists.

## Dependencies

macOS: `brew install zig@0.13.0 xorriso`
